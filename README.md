Oil Token (OILTOKEN)

Overview:
Oil Token is a utility and asset-backed cryptocurrency built on the TON blockchain. Each token represents one barrel of crude oil in digital form, bridging the global energy sector with decentralized finance. It enables transparent, secure, and borderless access to energy-backed assets for users worldwide.

Problem:
Traditional oil markets are centralized, inaccessible to small investors, and lack transparency. Trading and ownership are often limited by intermediaries, regulations, and high costs.

Solution:
Oil Token (OILTOKEN) democratizes access to the energy market by tokenizing crude oil. Through blockchain technology, investors can trade, stake, and track oil-based assets securely and transparently. The token enables global participation without traditional financial barriers.

Utility:
- Trade OILTOKEN on decentralized exchanges (DEX) such as Ston.fi.
- Use in energy-backed decentralized applications (dApps).
- Participate in staking and rewards programs.
- Long-term vision: establish price correlation between OILTOKEN and global crude oil value.

Tokenomics:
- Total Supply: 10,000,000,000 OILTOKEN
- Locked Supply: 5,000,000,000 tokens locked for 5 years.
  - After 5 years, 1B tokens are released over 10 months (100M/month).
